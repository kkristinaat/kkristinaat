PORTFOLIO

About me

My name is Krystyna Atamanchuk. I have recently embarked on a career change journey in order to become a Software Tester. This career path has interested 
me for quite a while, so I am excited to be given a chance to prove my skills. I believe that high quality is the bestselling point of services and 
products. Thanks to my diversified experience I have highly developed interpersonal skills and empathy, which help me see the bigger picture and 
function well within a team. My international experience has also equipped me with valuable tools, such as open-mindedness and adaptability.
In this portfolio I would like to share my testing knowledge and exhibit my technical skills, which I gained during the testing course
I have completed and through self-learning. I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field. 
This is why I am now looking for a junior position in testing.

My experience

I have worked as a Notary Assistant in the private company for over 5 years. Also I am an active participant on crowdtesting platforms like uTest and Digivante. I have participated in different projects where I was able to test software as a user.
